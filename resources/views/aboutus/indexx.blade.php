							Like most beautiful stories..

                            This story was created at a difficult time..
                            A birth of a community of people, who want to achieve their dreams..
                            This is a technical community, but most importantly it's a new family, full of halp and support ..
                            It's also an opportunity for everyone to help and to be helped..
                            The community gives you, and you give back to the community whenever you're able to..
                            This story is not just a story of a new community, it's the story of all of us..
                            Some people who are willing to work hard for their dreams and future..
                            And some other people who are ready to help you with that..
                            As now on friend..
                            There won't be "you" here or "i"
                            There will be all of us..
                            And always remember..
                            All for one..
                            One for all.

                                    all companies would ask you if you ever worked in teams ..
                                    this would be a great point to put in your cv !

                                    everybody must have started something and eventually quit everything and stop ..
                                    why ?
                                    because its the human nature , it loses passion ..
                                    but what if you have someone who encourages you every now and then ?
